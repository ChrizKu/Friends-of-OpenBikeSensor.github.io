# Use the OpenBikeSensor

## Quick start guide
> This assumes you have a working OpenBikeSensor. [If not start here](https://Friends-of-OpenBikeSensor.github.io/blob/master/README.md)

In case you might get a OpenBikeSensor, you should do some first steps.

1. Check, if your handlebar fits the OpenBikeSensor's display/button holder.  
There are basically two different kinds of handlebars: thinner ones, with a 25,4mm diameter and the other ones, with a 31.8mm diameter. You might create some kind of adapter, if the device is designed for 31,8mm and you have a 25,4mm handlebar, but the other way around is not possible
2. Measure the distance between the outer edge of the device and the end of your handlebar. Enter these values into the configuration options.
3. Set your privacy zone(s). You could probably get the GPS location with any digital map app. Enter these values into the configuration options.
4. Check the SD card, if it's ok and - in best case - empty.
5. Load the device's battery.
6. Put it on the bike and go for a ride. Please take care about traffic around you and don't let the OpenBikeSensor distract you!


## Wiki

### Use

Don't put too much attention on the OpenBikeSensor, always take care about the traffic around you!  
* Power on the device and - if possible - wait until the device has a GPS fix, i.e. your GPS location. Since it's not using the location services, you know from your mobile phone, this might take some time. The display will exit the status screen, as soon as your location is known. In case you can't wait due to some reasons, you could skip the wait with a push of the button. While moving, it might take up to 15mins, until the devices knows where you are.
* Ride your bike and push the button every time you're passed (no matter if it's a car or truck or bus or motorbike). To get some idea, how often close passes occur, it's important to confirm every pass, not only the close ones. 
* Power off. Keep in mind to always keep the button pushed, when you switch off the device!

### Start Configuration

You can enter the configuration mode by pushing the button while turning on the device. 

#### Access Point Mode
- On first start of the configuration mode or if you are outside of the Range of your WiFi, the OpenBikeSensor will open a unique WiFi access point 
- The access point is named after the MAC adress "OpenBikeSensor-xxxxxxxxxxxx" with the initial password "12345678" 
- The configuration page can be found on "http://openbikesensor.local" or "172.20.0.1" on the AP 

#### WiFi Mode
- It might be neccessary to de-activate the mobile data on your mobile phone to access this page.  
- OBS can also connect to an existing WiFi, if credentials were entered in a previous configuration (see WiFi Settings) 
- Connected to an existing WiFi, the IP adress of the configuration page is shown on the device's display. 

### Structure of the Configuration Menus

#### General

##### Sensor

Define the offset between the end of your handle bar and the outer edge of the OpenBikeSensor. These values will automatically get substracted from the current measurement. Additionally you could "swap" the left and right measurement, in case you flip the device on your bike.

##### GPS

You could define, in which way your device will acknowledge a valid GPS fix and starts operation. Typically it will start regular operation when it has contact to 4 gps satellites.

##### Generic Display

- flip the display, if you need to mount it upside down 
- invert the display bright / dark parts, which might help in bright sunlight.

##### Measurement Display

Here are several options, which values you might want to see on your display. 
- "simple mode" – display only of measurement to the left
- Show left / right measurement
- Show satellite – display of number of gps satellites recognized by the device (more satellites – more accurate positioning)
- Show velocity – display of actual speed (quite rough because of slow measurement intervals)
- Show confirmation stats – counts button press and confirmed detection of surpassing events 
- Show nerd details for distance sensors – display of raw data of sensors and number of measuring events within one second (helpful for troubleshooting)

##### Privacy Options

To keep some privacy, you could tell your device to stop recording near your home or any other privacy zone. This could be no recording at all or just no GPS-tracking any more, but still storing all confirmed passes.
> Define your home location and diameter of the privacy zone in the corresponding menu 

##### Upload User Data

Setup for upload-server to collect track data
- Preset for HLRS-project: openbikesensor.hlrs.de
- To upload track data, you need a user account on the website openbikesensor.hlrs.de (or other compatible online-service) 
- API Key: Insert the individual API key from your user account at openbiksensor.hlrs.de in the field below the upload sensor

##### Operation
- Enable Bluetooth – (from Firmware version 0.3dev.) check if you want to connect your Openbiksesensor to a compatible Smartphone App s.a. SimRa
- SimRa Mode – check if you are connecting the Openbikesensor with the SimRa App

#### Privacy Zones

You could set as many privacy zones, as you like, including their own radius. 
In the Privacy Options you define, how your OpenBikeSensor behaves in the Privacy Zone(s).

#### WiFi Settings

The OpenBikeSensor can connect to an available WiFi if you supply its credentials. This is convenient when you want to stay connected to your local WiFi when configuring the sensor. It will tell you the IP adress to connect to on the display.

To upload track from the Open Bike Sensor directly a WiFi connection with internet access is necessary

#### Backup & Restore

Here you can Backup the Configuration of your OpenBikeSensor on your local PC or mobile Device
To restore from a saved configuration chose the corresponding file in the menu dialog
Use this option befor firmware updates and evice changes

#### Update Firmware

After downloading the latest release (or any other version, in case you need a special setup), just click on "Update" in the options. Select the downloaded file and click update. The device will automatically reboot after a successful update.

You can directly upload a precompiled binary; the latest release can always be found [here](https://github.com/Friends-of-OpenBikeSensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/releases).  
There are several chapters in the configuration.


#### Reboot

This button restarts the device into the regular measurement mode and leaves the options.
